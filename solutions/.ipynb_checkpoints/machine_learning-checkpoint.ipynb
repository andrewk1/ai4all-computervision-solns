    "For this homework we will implement **logistic regression**. You will need to use, and fix, the functions in the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "### models.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/models.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains a **class** for **LogisticRegression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will **not** need to change any code in this file, but you **will** need to instantiate these classes and call their **train** and **predict** methods in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### model_helpers.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py)\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook provides more moving parts, and more chances to be creative with how your design your expriments. As a bit of guidance, we recommend doing things in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Complete the \"predict_probability\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This function is **necessary** for making predictions, and also training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Complete the \"sgd\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This function is **necessary** for training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Run the **Unit Testing** block in this notebook to see if there are any problems with \"predict_probability\" and \"sgd\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember: You must restart the Kernel (top bar) in order for your changes to other files to take effect! (Kernel >> Restart & Clear Output)"
