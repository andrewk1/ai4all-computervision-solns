    "\n",
    "For our project we will implement **logistic regression** and train it to classify locations of high poverty and low poverty using satellite imagery of Uganda. This will be a complete machine learning experiment, using a training, validation, and testing set, so we will implement **cross validation** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use, and fix, the functions in the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "### models.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/models.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains **classes** for **LogisticRegression** and two **baseline** models: One that guesses randomly, and one that always guesses the most frequent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will **not** need to change any code in this file, but you **will** need to instantiate these classes and call their **train** and **predict** methods in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### metrics.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/metrics.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides a set of functions for judging how well your model performs given some data. The metrics include accuracy, f1 score, and area under the curve (auc).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will **not** need to change any code in this file, but you **will** need to use these functions in the __cross_validation__ function in [experiment_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/experiment_helpers.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### model_helpers.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains training and prediction functions used by our **Logistic Regression** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your job is to complete the functions in this file! **\n",
    "\n",
    "### experiment_helpers.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/experiment_helpers.py)\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook provides more moving parts, and more chances to be creative with how your design your expriments. As a bit of guidance, we recommend doing things in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Look over the files [models.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/models.py) and [metrics.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/metrics.py). You do **not** need to understand every line of code, but try to get a general sense of the **functions** and **classes** contained in these files. Can you describe the inputs and outputs to each function?\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Complete the \"create_trucksplanes_dataset\" function in [experiment_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/experiment_helpers.py). This function is **necessary** for creating the Trucks and Planes dataset that we can use to get a general sense for how logistic regression works.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Complete the \"predict_probability\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This function is **necessary** for making predictions, and also training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Complete the \"sgd\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This function is **necessary** for training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) **Optional:** Run the **Unit Testing** block in this notebook to see if there are any problems with \"predict_probability\" and \"sgd\". Don't worry about \"batch_sgd\" for now!\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Complete the **cross_validation** function in [experiment_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/experiment_helpers.py). This is the \"main function\" for the entire project! When its complete, you can start getting experimental results on your training, validation, and testing sets!\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Run the first few blocks of this notebook to get results on the **Trucks and Planes** dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "(8) **Optional:** Complete the \"batch_sgd\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). TYouu can complete the project without this function. But if you can figure it out, you may get better results!\n",
    "\n",
    "(9) Time to do some real Poverty Mapping! Go back and complete the \"create_uganda_dataset\" in [experiment_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/experiment_helpers.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "(10) Run the **Classifying Poverty** block in this notebook. Adjust your hyperparameters, and improve your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "(11) Run the final cell and see how well your model does on the Uganda test set!\n",
