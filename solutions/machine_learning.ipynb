    "# Machine Learning Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework we will implement **logistic regression**. You will need to use, and fix, the functions in the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "### models.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/models.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains a **class** for **LogisticRegression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will **not** need to change any code in this file, but you **will** need to instantiate these classes and call their **train** and **predict** methods in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### model_helpers.py [link](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains training and prediction functions used by our **Logistic Regression** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your job is to complete the functions in this file!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides more moving parts, and more chances to be creative with how your design your expriments. As a bit of guidance, we recommend doing things in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Complete the \"sigmoid\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This function is **necessary** for making predictions, and also training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Complete the \"predict_probability\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This function is **necessary** for making predictions, and also training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Run the **Prediction Testing** block in this notebook to see if there are any problems with \"predict_probability\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) EXTRA CREDIT (Hard difficulty): Complete the \"sgd\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This function is **not needed** for passing the homework for full credit, but is conceptually important to training machine learning models and can be a good exercise. Please reach out to the instructors if you have questions. Run the **SGD Testing** block once you think you have a working implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For more info on gradient descent, check out [this link](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/#gd)**\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) SUPER EXTRA CREDIT (Even harder difficulty): Complete the \"batch_sgd\" function in [model_helpers.py](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/project/model_helpers.py). This is similar to \"sgd\", but instead of performing updates over each data point, we perform updates over a \"batch\" of data. Refer to the previous link on this \"minibatch gradient descent\" procedure. If you have any questions again, please reach out. Run the **Batch SGD Testing** block once you think you have a working implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
